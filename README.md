# 🛒 Flipkart Mini Project (Python + MySQL)

This is a **mini console-based Python application** that connects to a MySQL database and simulates basic Flipkart-like functionality for **user registration and login**. It is built as a beginner-friendly project to practice **Python OOP concepts** and **database operations**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **User Registration**

* Add new users to the database with name, email, and password.

✅ **User Login**

* Verify credentials and greet logged-in users.

✅ **MySQL Integration**

* Uses Python’s `mysql.connector` library to connect and operate on a MySQL database.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **MySQL**
* **MySQL Connector for Python**

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flipkart-mini-project.git
cd flipkart-mini-project
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Install the required Python library:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up MySQL Database

* Create a database named: `hit-db-demo`
* Create a table named `users` using this SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```

### 4️⃣ Configure Database Credentials

Ensure your MySQL server is running and update these credentials in `DBHelper` class if needed:

```python
self.conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="",
    database="hit-db-demo"
)
```

Do you want me to:
✅ Add **a badge-style heading (like Python version, license)** to make it more professional?
✅ Or keep it clean and minimal for now?

Would you like me to **make a ready-to-paste README with your GitHub username pre-filled**?
